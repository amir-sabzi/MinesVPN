## Experiment description
In this experiment, I tried to measure the interval time between two consequtive packets. I tried to do this with modifying timestamping script at the libmoon/lua/timestamping.lua. To do this, instead of measuring the time between two send as receive packets, I measured time between sending two consecutive packets.

## Experiment results
This method is not working clearly. We calculated times with 1.5 as average. Considering the rate and timing resolution. These values are clearly meaningless. I will repeat this experiment in a new format in the next experiment.
